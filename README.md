# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

==============================================================================================================
This is ToDo application that has the following feature:

1. Add a todo item.
2. Delete a todo item.
3. Edit a todo item. As soon as you edit the todo item there will be conditional rendering and instead of todo item + delete button + edit button there will be a text box and save button.
